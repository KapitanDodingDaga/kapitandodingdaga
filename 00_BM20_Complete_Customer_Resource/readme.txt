First download EEPROM_Tools to find out IC version. It is either 002 or 203 version. Depending upon IC version download the appropriate tools from 203_Tools and 002_Tools and patch code from BM20_Patch_Code folder.
Follow section 2.4.3 from BM20_EvaluationBoard_UserGuide.pdf to create patch code and section 2.4.4 to program EEPROM.
Thanks
