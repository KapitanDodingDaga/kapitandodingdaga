    <p align=right>Version: <b>~Demoversion~</b></p>
    <h2>Welcome!</h2>
    <p></p>You are currently connected to:<p></p>
    <ul>
    <li>SSID name: <b>~ssid~</b></li>
    <li>Security type (None, WEP, WPA, WPA2, WPA-AUTO): <b>~curPrivacy~</b></li>
    <li>WLAN type: <b>~curWLAN~</b></li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>There are five menu items on the left hand side.  The first is the current page you see,
    which provides information about the demo application.</p>
    
    <p>The second menu item (Lighting Control), allows the user to control the assigned lights in a room.</p>

    <p>The third menu item (Room Setup), will display a page for creating a room and assigning it a specific PANID and Channel.</p>
    
    <p>The fourth menu item (Lighting Configuration), will display a page that will scan for all MiWi nodes on the specified Channel.  All Devices discovered can then be commissioned to join a specific Room (PAN ID and channel).</p>
    
    <p>The fifth menu item (Configure WiFi Settings), will display a page that will allow you to scan
    for nearby networks, see them, and then connect to another network.  After the attempt is made
    to connect to the new network, you will have to transition your wireless PC,laptop, or handheld
    wireless device to this new network in order to see that the device has indeed changed networks.</p>
     
    <h2>Browser-based Device Configuration</h2>
    
    <p>This showcases how to configure and program an embedded Wi-Fi device that does not
    have a natural keyboard and screen.  By using the internal webserver that accompanies
    the Microchip TCP/IP stack, end-users can use their browser as a conduit for programming
    the device with the correct network parameters.</p>
    
    <p></p>For a wireless network, an end-user would need to have knowledge of at least the following information:<p></p>
    <ul>
    <li>SSID name</li>
    <li>Security type (None, WEP, WPA, WPA2, WPA-AUTO)</li>
    <li>Security key</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>As pioneered by most modern operating systems, the application also has the ability to scan for 
    all networks in the vicinity of the device, and display them to the user.  The user will
    also be given additional information about the network such as whether security is enabled
    or how far away the other network is.  Users are also given the opportunity to enter all the
    network information manually, which is required when trying to connect to a network with a 
    hidden SSID.</p>
