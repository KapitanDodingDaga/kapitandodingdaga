This codes are not production ready. Some codes are tested and some are not.   As of today, I don't have any clue on what this repository will contain in the future. I just wanted to have a backup of my codes because the flash based memory products you can find in the market today only last for around 5 years and I got a whole lot of codes and knowledge base missing  because of my external flash drive is now corrupted. bad! bad! bad!  If you have questions, suggestions, corrections etc email me at  kapitandodingdaga@gmail.com.
